# Modified GumTree

This is a slightly modified version of the upstream repository where:
  1. Support for the `CMake` language is added through [this version of this repositoy](https://github.com/mahtab-nejati/tree-sitter-parser/releases/tag/ASE2024).
  2. The `.dot` output generation is slightly modified to avoid truncation of node labels and generate parsable node labels.

A comprehensive documentation for GumTree is available in the [README](https://github.com/GumTreeDiff/gumtree/blob/main/README.md) and [Wiki page](https://github.com/GumTreeDiff/gumtree/wiki/Getting-Started) of the upstream repository.
